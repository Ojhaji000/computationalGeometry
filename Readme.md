# Computational Geometry
- This project is about solving the below problem:
- In a 3D space, find whether a line is intersecting with a triangle or not?
- This project is on going right now

 ## How to run it
 - download the project
 - install [MSYS64](https://www.msys2.org/) and follow it's instructions 
 <!-- - open terminal, make a build directory-->
 - open project directory in terminal and run the below command
```
g++ main.cpp Vec3.cpp Utility.cpp -o learncpp.exe
./learncpp.exe
```
- a "output.txt" file will be generated, whose content could be copy pasted in **[desmos3D](https://www.desmos.com/3d)** and viewed
